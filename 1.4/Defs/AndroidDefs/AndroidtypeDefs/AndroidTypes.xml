		<description>Bio-Androids are made to be as close to humans as possible, meaning unless you look at them surgically, they look human.If they never get injured, then sometimes they are never aware of their synthetic nature, just knowing they have to take a pill every so often!</description>
		<descriptionShort>When specially designed, some rare androids are almost indistinquisible from humans, sometimes to the point where they never know they aren't humans, only thinking they need to take a "pill" every few days, not knowing that pill is the reactor!</descriptionShort>
